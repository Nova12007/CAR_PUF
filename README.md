# CAR-PUF
This repository contains submission for the assignment of the course CS771 under Prof. Purushottam Kar in 2023-24-II semester (in group of six) at IIT Kanpur. Here, we have designed a linear model that can crack a Companion Arbiter PUF. We have tuned the hyperparameters appropriately and obtained an accuracy of 99.19% on the test data using the LinearSVC model with the squared-hinge loss function.
